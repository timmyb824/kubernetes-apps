# Summary

Monitor any host using Prometheus for metrics, Alert manager for alerts, Cadvisor for container data, and Node Exporter for host data.

I experimented with deploying prometheus using different configurations to try and get the best performance. This is the reason for there being two options available. In the end, I choose to go with the `kube-prometheus-stack` instead.
